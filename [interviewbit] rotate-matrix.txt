Approach 1: Rotate starting from outer boundary and then go the inner boundary one by one.
For each boundary element there will be a loop of 4 times. 
For e.g. (0, 0) -> (0, n-1) -> (n-1, n-1) -> (n-1, 0) -> (0, 0)

Approach 2:
(i, j) -> (j, n-i-1) is the final state.

This can be done in two phase.
A) (i, j) -> (j, i)
B) (j, i) -> (j, n-i-1)

A can be done by reflecting along the diagonal, and B can be done by reflecting along
the middle column.
