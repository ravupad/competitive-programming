Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping 
intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the 
intervals in the input.

---

Sort the intervals by the starti.
Use two counters count, and j (starting with 0 and 1).

loop 
* interval[count], and interval[j] can be merged if start[j] <= end[count].
  in this case merge modify i with end[count] = max(end[count], end[j]).
  j = j + 1;
* interval[count] and interval[j] cannot be merged. count++;
  interval[count] = interval[j]
  j = j+1
